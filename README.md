Classroom assignment for Friday, November 14, 2014

Your task for today:
You have a fully written website for our web design company, which is index.html in this repository. Experiment with adding styles to the various elements on the page.

At the top of the page you will notice an internal stylesheet. This includes all the styles for the various elements, such as strong, em, and body. Add in declarations to each of these styles. Remember:
- Your properties and values should be separated by a colon
- Your declarations should end with a semicolon

We also see two new concepts here. For em and ol, we see the concept of a "class." We can set a category of tags to affect, as long as we include that category as an attribute in the tag. We include the class as part of our selector.

To see this in action, look at em.phone in our style sheet. That sets the style for any <em> tag that includes the attribute class="phone". We can see one <em> tag like that at the bottom of the page.

The second new concept is that <a> has a few different selectors. a:link sets the style for a normal link. a:visited sets the style for a visited link. a:hover sets the style for when our mouse is hovering over the link.

When you are done, commit your changes to the repository as a pull request! 

If you need to obtain CSS styles for each, go to w3schools.com/css. You can also use the information you gathered for your worksheet on Wednesday/Thursday.
